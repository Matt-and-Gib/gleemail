# We'd love to work together!

## However, please know that we will not accept pull requests which do not meet some basic guidelines:

- Please make an attempt to match our established programming style (in VS Code: {BasedOnStyle: Google, UseTab: Always, IndentWidth: 4, TabWidth: 4})
- Use verbose function and variable names so that your code can be easily read and understood without the need for unnecessary comments
- Try to keep Arduino functionality minimal and limited to main.cpp
- Design with the Arduino's limited memory and speed in mind

Know that we'll thoroughly review your pull request before merging it, and may have suggestions or questions before anything is approved.

If you're wondering where to get started, please review any currently open issues, browse [our project board](https://github.com/orgs/Matt-and-Gib/projects/1), or get in touch with us here on GitHub!

Thanks!
