We'd love to work together, but please know that we will not accept pull requests which do not meet some basic guidelines:

- Please make an attempt to match our established programming style (in VS Code: {BasedOnStyle: Google, UseTab: Always, IndentWidth: 4, TabWidth: 4})
- Use verbose function and variable names so that your code can be easily read and understood without the need for unnecessary comments
- Try to keep Arduino functionality limited to the project .ino
- Design with the Arduino's limited memory and speed in mind

Know that we'll thoroughly review your pull request before merging it, and may have suggestions or questions before anything is approved.

Thanks!
