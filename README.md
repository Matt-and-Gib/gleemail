### <a name="info"></a>**Basic Info**
What is glEEmail? Welcome to the future, kid. glEEmail is like sending your uncle a telegram, except it doesn't cost 25 cents per character. It's easy, and fun (some assembly required).

glEEmail allows you to send messages to (predefined) clients over the Internet via that old Morse Code switch that you have installed next to your computer terminal. Just hook it up and get flyin'!

Okay, for real, glEEmail is a side project while we're waiting for 200 SMD LEDs to arrive from China. The project allows you to test input and output from your Arduino, and to send messages to an Arduino at a different IP address as long as both can connect to the Internet.
