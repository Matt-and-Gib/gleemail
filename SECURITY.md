# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

As glEEmail is in active development, there may be several branches ahead of main at any time. Main should be considered the "stable" "release" version, however support may be provided (but is not guaranteed) for any branch in active development.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

glEEmail is not software that should ever be used for security-critical communication, therefore we will accept vulnerability reports in standard Issues or Pull Requests.
